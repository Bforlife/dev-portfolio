    <h1 class="text-center pt-3"> How to Write Clean and Maintainable Code</h1>
    <h3 class="text-center pt-2"> 
    Writing clean and maintainable code is essential for ensuring that your projects are easy to understand, debug, and enhance over time. Here are key practices to follow:</h3>
    <p class="fs-4">1. <strong>Follow Coding Standards</strong><br>
    Description: Adhere to industry coding standards or your team's coding conventions. Consistent naming conventions, indentation, and formatting make your code more readable.</p>
    <p class="fs-4">2. <strong> Avoid Code Duplication</strong>
    Description: Reuse code by creating functions or classes instead of duplicating code. This reduces the chances of bugs and simplifies maintenance.</p>
    <p class="fs-4">3. <strong>Write Comments Wisely</strong><br>
    Description: Use comments to explain why something is done, not how. Focus on the rationale behind complex logic instead of stating the obvious.</p>
    <p class="fs-4">4. <strong>Keep Functions Small</strong> <br>
    Description: Break down complex functions into smaller, single-purpose functions. This makes your code easier to test, debug, and maintain.</p>
    <p class="fs-4">5. <strong>Document Your Code</strong><br>
    Description: Maintain clear documentation for your codebase, including setup instructions, API documentation, and usage examples. Good documentation helps others understand and use your code effectively.</p>
    <p class="fs-4">6. <strong> Implement Error Handling</strong><br>

    Description: Gracefully handle errors and exceptions. Proper error handling prevents crashes and provides useful feedback to users and developers.</p>
    <p class="fs-4">7. <strong> Use Meaningful Names</strong><br>

    Description: Choose descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Clear names help others (and your future self) understand the purpose of your code at a glance.</p>


    <i> <strong>Conclusion</strong>
    Clean and maintainable code is a hallmark of a professional developer. By following these best practices, youâ€™ll create code that is not only functional but also easy to read, understand, and maintain. Invest time in writing clean code today to save time and effort in the future!</i>
